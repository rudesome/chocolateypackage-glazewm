GlazeWM is a tiling window manager for Windows inspired by i3wm.

[![Package GlazeWM](https://github.com/rudesome/chocolateypackage-glazewm/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rudesome/chocolateypackage-glazewm/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Changes (chocolatey package)

Version 3.1.1 was still with the EXE installer (included Zebar).
From Version >3.3.0 the author also published a MSI standalone package which only includes GlazeWM.

---

## Zebar

Zebar is a status bar / desktop widgets from the same author (glzr-io). <br>
Zebar has its own [package on chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zebar) <br>
It is undependant from each other and you may choose to use it with GlazeWM or not.. <br>
It is also nicer with cleanup and upgrades cycles.
